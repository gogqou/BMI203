Implements Smith Waterman Algorithm for local sequence alignment



Implement the Smith-Waterman algorithm and instrument the code such
that it can use any scoring matrix provided (i.e. will read it in from
a separate file). 

Scoring matrix includes gap-scoring scheme and substitution matrix; needs to be able to read in from outside file.



Take input: seq1 and seq2
Substitution matrix file--should call a parsing function to read in the file
Gap scoring definitions

Output: filled out similarity matrix H
